===============

Prolific Library App

This is the final branch of the SWAG committee, this app will allow the committee to track changes to books from their library.

App initially created in Swift and some Objective-C created in the end of the app development due to POSTing issues from Swift.

(There is a pull to refresh on the tableview itself to reload the view of changes made to the library)
